# TS-Search
A interesting "Search engine" with the help of the npmjs API

With the help of https://registry.npmjs.org/-/v1/search?text=react, AKA npmjs library, I completed a very tiny but kind interesting search engine to help me fetch data from remote and display it on screen superior.

This code demo proves my understanding and application of React, React-Redux, Redux-thunk, TypeScript combined, and I will continue to update my repositories!
